# StackOverflow

We have five main actors in our system:

Admin: Mainly responsible for blocking or unblocking members.

Guest: All guests can search and view questions.

Member: Members can perform all activities that guests can, in addition to which they can add/remove questions, answers, and comments. Members can delete and un-delete their questions, answers or comments.

Moderator: In addition to all the activities that members can perform, moderators can close/delete/undelete any question.

System: Mainly responsible for sending notifications and assigning badges to members.

Here are the top use cases for Stack Overflow:
1) Search questions.
2) Create a new question with bounty and tags.
3) Add/modify answers to questions.
4) Add comments to questions or answers.
5) Moderators can close, delete, and un-delete any question.
